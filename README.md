# Intro to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
By the UCLA Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) AI

## Summary
Intro to AI/ML
This is a two-quarter course taught by UCLA students to introduce high-school students to artificial intelligence and its many applications. The number of weeks required to complete the course and start date are flexible.

## Description
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become extremely prevalent in society, from powering the voice assistants on our smartphones to improving medical diagnoses. Regardless of what areas high schoolers plan to pursue upon graduation, they’re likely to encounter AI and ML-related technologies in their future careers.

ACM AI is a student organization at UCLA dedicated to educating curious individuals about artificial intelligence and its applications. For 4 years, we’ve been hosting AI/ML workshops on campus for UCLA students, preparing them to pursue advanced opportunities in the fields. In the coming academic year, we hope to spread knowledge of AI/ML to high schoolers who are interested in exploring technology-related fields.
